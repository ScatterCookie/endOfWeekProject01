Assignment Reflection

1. The requirements of the project where something I had to wrap my head around, thisis not something I have done before but it is somethingn that I have always had a passion for. Looking at the scope of what we had to do is something very basic that happens with every day tasks, I break this down into multiple tasks that I can complete in a small time frame. Out of the requirements that we had I completed all of the ones on the sheet, including on optional extra's that were put forward for us to do.

2. This week as it stands and as I have knowledge of other programming skills this wasn't too difficult for me so as it stands I don't think I missed anything from the spec given

3. I found some of the final touches a little difficult, it took me a good while to figure out why the background music only started to play when I editted the code is VS but I found that it was due to me having the element inspector open.
